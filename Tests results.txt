1) Login page:
	- auto IP list works
	- login works
	- trying to log in after already logged in gives "authentication failed" error
2) Tests:
	- running 'tests' works
	- start engines 'works'
3) Monitor:
	- 'works'
4) Misc:
	- disconnect button says You will have to log in again, not true, can login without it - probably cookies
	- checking for connection button drops connection
	- dynamic checking for connection doesn't work
	- after disconnecting the router it still 'works' - it doesn't get any real data and cookies make it act like it's all good
